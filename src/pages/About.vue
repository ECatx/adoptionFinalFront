                 The shelter has grown to be a staple of the community in helping find forever homes for hundreds of cats in the community each year.

                    Here at Cat’s With Hats we believe in keeping kids safe and finding a cat that can get along with your children. All our cats are listed as being kid safe or not. With cats that are kid safe we can assure you that these cats will not bite your young children and are okay to be handled by children. Before adopting out our cats we place them with children to see how they react to being picked up and moved around by small kids.
                     After thoroughly testing each cat we feel safe in saying if the cats are okay to live in your household with small children.
